# CATALOGUE-OF-MY-THINGS

## Description
In this project, we created a console app that will help us to keep records of different types of things we won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented to us in the project requirement document. The data will be stored in JSON files but you will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to our program's class structure.
